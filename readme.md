## SAWWAVE SYNTH : 
This is a relatively simple synth program using SDL2 and a little bit of STK.
Most of the audio processing is handled by me, but I'm using STK for things here and there to make things simpler.

At the moment it simply has a fir filter applied. Was gonna try FreeVerb but it seemed a little scuffed.

## DEPENDENCIES : 
```lSDL2```
```STK-DEVEL```

## BUILD : 
```./b.sh```
